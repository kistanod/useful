# Links I personally found useful

Though I might not know all of it, I have been learning Computer Science(CS) and Software Engineering(SWE) for long enough to share knowledge myself.  

There is a **million and more** people that are better at this than me. Still I think if you are just beginning to learn about SWE and CS, you should find this compilation relatively useful.
